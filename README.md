# Phobetor's Curse
## Introduction
Phobetor's curse is a dungeon-crawler style game with a straight forward combat system. In each level, the player advances through stages by defeating enemies in rooms, and fights a boss, which will give them a new ability. Player progression is primarily through the acquisition of new abilities, as well as mastery over gameplay such as animation cancelling and targetting their skills.

### Plot
Elina is tormented by recurring nightmares; not the usual kind that humans generate on their own, but she was bewitched by a Tormentor. Eventually, she has a nightmare that seems more like an SOS than a Tormentor's affliction. In that dream, she sees the abandoned mansion in which she used to live. She goes to the mansion to answer the call for help, looks around, and sees a photograph containing some girls which seemed familiar. She hadn't seen them in real life, but in her recurring dreams. She touches the photo, and a wave of darkness overcomes her. Transported to the dream world, she comes across a girl, Aether, who explains that she and six other orphans who lived in this mansion had been trapped in an endless nightmare by a Phobetor - a witch with an affinity for dreams - the Spider Queen Theraphosa. Elina, who was born with the same affinities that a Tormentor possesses, was the only one who could hear her cry for help. If Elina could release the seven orphans, she could break the cycle of torment that the Phobetor caused. As Elina walks the journey to free the girls and face the Spider Queen, she discovers that Aether was not telling her the full story, and there was more than meets the eye.

## Mechanics

### Combat
#### Health Points
Damage to the player is rather forgiving. The player has 100HP, and ideally, the player does not take damage. When the player takes damage, if they remain undamaged for 5 seconds, they begin to regenerate health, and are fully regenerated in 5 seconds.

#### Mental Power
MP in Phobetor's Curse can be thought of in terms of time. MP regenerates at a significant rate. When MP is empty, it takes 10 seconds to recharge. In other words, continuous use of abilities can be thought of in terms of rationing 100MP over 10 seconds.

Blink - Use 5 times in a burst, use every 2 seconds continuously.
